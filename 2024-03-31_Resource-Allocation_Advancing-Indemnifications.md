# How do you advance indemnification from those with ability according to need?

my gut says: communication models, synchronizing the asynchronous arising of exposure, and responsibility assignment

## Government:

Well, fire insurance used to be coupled with pounds of tea - when this was a new instrument of assurance... now, there is "Costco's zero questions asked return policy" setting a competitive edge on Amazon Asurion insurance with each product transacted... I see an issue with art valuation, but that's a tangent that the IMF is trickling down into low-level banking and layers of the internet... I'm curious if I should go down the thought path of, for instance, a requirement of "screen snapshots" for unemployment allocation...

## Corps & Friends:

but, I am more getting glimpses of the unknowns of others' hobbies, collections, creativities, and ~obsessions, and seeing the coupling of [connection with the things of these physical attachments] with [advancing assurances and indemnifications] and am wondering what the indicators of improvement would be in our community? Like seeing people pursue what they want to pursue, not holding others to the image of who they were, and not letting memes, narratives, and satires push those in need out of their Dunbar numbers



## ChatGPT Response:

Advancing indemnifications from those with ability according to need typically involves implementing a system of taxation or wealth redistribution. Here are some general steps that can be taken:

1. **Assess Ability to Pay:** Determine the ability of individuals or entities to contribute based on their income, wealth, or other relevant factors.

2. **Identify Needs:** Identify the needs of the community or individuals requiring indemnification. This could include basic necessities such as food, shelter, healthcare, education, etc.

3. **Establish a System:** Implement a system, such as progressive taxation or targeted financial assistance programs, to collect funds from those with greater ability and distribute them to those in need.

4. **Legislation and Policy:** Develop and implement legislation and policies that support the system, ensuring that it is fair, transparent, and effective.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustments:** Continuously monitor the system to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the community and making adjustments as necessary to improve its effectiveness.

6. **Public Awareness and Support:** Educate the public about the importance of supporting those in need and garnering support for the system through public campaigns and advocacy efforts.

7. **Partnerships and Collaboration:** Work with other stakeholders, including government agencies, non-profit organizations, and businesses, to leverage resources and maximize impact.

Overall, advancing indemnifications from those with ability according to need requires a comprehensive approach that considers both the ability to pay and the needs of the community, while also ensuring fairness and sustainability.
