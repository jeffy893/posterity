Homie lived a life of deliberate self-sufficiency. His days began before dawn, tending to the six cows that grazed in his pasture and the half-dozen sheep that annually brought new lambs into the world. A flock of chickens provided a steady supply of eggs. He eschewed pork, a decision solidified years ago by the intelligent gaze of a pig in a slaughterhouse. Fish, when he desired it, required a trip to Alaska or a trade with a nearby fisherman.

 His greenhouse in Arizona yielded a bounty of vegetables, and bulk grains were purchased as needed. He saw no need for complete isolation, understanding the value of trade for items like citrus. A loyal dog assisted him with the livestock.

Beyond the farm, Homie was a computer engineer. He maintained his professional work remotely, finding a balance between his physical labors and his cerebral pursuits. He consulted the Foxfire journals, a compendium of Appalachian self-sufficiency, systematically learning to craft everything from chairs to snares. He found deep satisfaction in producing, rather than simply consuming.

Friends and family visited, though Homie rarely left his homestead. His diet was precise: meat, vegetables, and eggs, with occasional condiments. Electricity provided modern conveniences. He hired farmhands when extra assistance was required, paying them a reasonable wage. Physical exertion kept him fit, shedding any excess weight.

Homie attended church, finding his own peace there. He had no wife or children, a fact that neither bothered nor deterred him. When women attempted to confide in him or discuss their troubles, he would often respond with an astute, "Homie don't play that," and redirect the conversation. This earned him a reputation for being detached, though loving.

He recorded every thought, every observation, transcribing them and using AI to document his life. He synthesized various religious philosophies into his own rational framework, laughed often, and contributed to society through his engineering work.

Yet, despite his accomplishments, a subtle lack persisted. He had everything he needed, but something remained just beyond his grasp. He didn't quite grasp the full scope of human connection, the nuances of shared suffering. He was successful in his own terms, perhaps too successful, too insulated from the struggles of others. He just kept doing well, seemingly unaware of the broader world's pain. When people opened up to him, he would simply repeat, "Homie don't play that." He was a man who lived fully within his own created world, thriving, but always a step removed from what he didn't quite understand.
