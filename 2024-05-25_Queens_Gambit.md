# Queen's Gambit


## Assumption

### 90% of Billionnaires are the first child of at least 4 children in an nuclear family

... so you're saying I got a chance!! ;)

## Model

|  | In Group | Out Group |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Educated   | W   | X |
| Uneducated   | Y   | Z |


### The fault of human truth (FHT) is where one believes it is GOOD for THAT to be TRUE for THEM but not THEM OVER THERE.

### The developmental stage of a child in a houselhold, a household in a neighborhood, a neighborhood in a community, ad infinitum: contributes to how much involvement the entity has with decision-making for the resource allocation and management with tools/machines within the subsystem (bound by Conway's Law).

## End in Mind

To first look inward for an impetus to change

## Approach

Ought the assumption be propagated in a capitalistic society, if the objective is to incentivize the populace to pursue fame, power, fortune, and games? How about if the objective is to encourage the people to practice going without?

## Formation

- Those who believe themselves to be in W are more likely to perform the FHT?
    * e.g. Students of Public Health at University of Arizona
    * e.g. Wearing a mask doesn't stop propagation of certin invisible enemies, but the FHT is appropriate for Z to think
- We will aim to survive with vitality of the flow of resources (e.g. further the legitimacy of the institutions we depend on)
    * Bound by Conway's, Parkinson's, and Murphy's Laws
- Propose Alternative Matrix for psychological states of being
    * Anima <--> Animus
    * Survitalism <--> Narcisism <--> Schizophrenia
        * [Ratopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink)
    * Dependent <--> Interdependent
    * Depression <--> Anxiety
    * Consequential <--> Deontological
- Fame, Power, Fortune, and Games being idols... do they need to be legitimized? ... as intitutions?
- Free Play <--> Instrumental Play <--> Deliberation
- Transparency as to the developmental stage of the supra entity in the subsystem makes a difference in development?
- Horizontal force to clarify, attribute, and model each layer of bloom's taxonomy...
    - Overlapping Ikigai... The Lord's keychain...
    - Vertical force to elevate or demote within bloom's taxonomy
- Liberal Risk Regime distribution of negligence with the belief in agency
    * Diligence stands by itself, negligence locks in-step with others
    * Choice being the sentience involved join of Intention per Negligence and Conditions of Outcome
    * Morale limited by potential conflicts when making common knowledge through synchronous modeling of risk factors
        - Lean Manufacturing
        - Toyota Way
        - 5 Sigma: Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, Sustain
        - Incorporate Service Science: Reduce Engagement Entropy... Dam Theory: Queueing Markov Chain
- Birth and death markov chain says at least 4 children need to be born to continue gene
- Can only meet ~20K people in a lifetime (1-2 people a day for 2 hours of intimate conversation)...
    * Limited by Dunbar Bowl
- $1M lasts 10 years at $100K/year expenses... retirement mathematics
- Material Capital doesn't quite cut it for accounting in modern economy... 3 sens
- Austrian Economics solves for the price of a glass of water... can return to the faucet... saturated markets...
- Accounting for the assumption based on this formation
- Again... you're saying I got a chance!
- So What?
    * Cognizance of Great Anxiety and Great Gaslighting is helpful so as to weight the value of narratives introudcing priorities in front of those common to all (Kant's Critique on Judgment...)
        * Modern Noble Lie: Inqiuity manifests in facial features
        * Address Marvel Propaganda of Thenos Mission
    * Maintain alignment with natural law - to be involved with broader scopes - earned by proper development
    * Glorify Jah
