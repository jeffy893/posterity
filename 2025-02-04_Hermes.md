# Hermes

Remember the first iPhone app that allowed you to look at any constellation, anywhere around you?
If you liked that, then you would love Hermes!
Let's listen in on some campgoers, talking about their Hermes:


Bob:
"Hey Jamal, you know how biddies love texting?"

Jamal:
"I do... but damnit, if that phone don't plug into a printer, what's the point?"

Bob:
"Check this out: go get Hermes on the app store"...

... (15 minutes later)

Jamal:
"Alright, done"

Bob:
"We must be made in the image of Orion... go check out the third star of Orion's dick"

Jamal:
"Aight"

Bob:
"Now move the slider to 93.7... and type the password: 'she gave me hermes'"

Jamal:
"Aight... hold on... okay, wtf... is that a dick pick?!"

Bob:
"Hahaha... it's a dick on a dick!... haha"

Jamal:
"So you're saying I can write anything in the sky?!"

Bob:
"Yah, the app uses the celestial positioning to host your messages in the sky... anyone in the world can see them if they tap into your channel..."

Jamal:
"Woah"
