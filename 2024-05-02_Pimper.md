Dorm Room - Afternoon

Jamal is swiping on his phone. Tim is playing a video game.

JAMAL
Hey Tim, could you resolve this PR?

TIM
What's her name?

JAMAL
Tammy

NARRATIVE
Jamal looks at Tim with pleading eyes. Tim gets a hand-wave gesture in his glasses.

TIM
What's her dimensions?

JAMAL
25, 22, 27

TIM
Does she want a parent?

JAMAL
Yah, ancestry says she's of the Kebra Negast... I'll have to ask my Dad.

NARRATIVE
Tim rolls his eyes, and focuses more on the game.

JAMAL
C'mon dude

TIM
I need 15 rether by Thursday...

JAMAL
Ugh, runescape is such a grind

TIM
It's either mine, kill crabs, or ask SAM.

JAMAL
I don't want to wear my pitbit, today... eh, whatever... I gotta go get class.

NARRATIVE
Jamal puts on his pitbit and leaves the dorm.
Jamal walks to the 1st bus.
Jamal looks around and sees only one green.
He thinks: "How much?"
His glasses show: "15 hour linger"
He thinks: "Omega, she must be so hot... add a reminder to linger"

On the way to Jamal's second bus, he sees a sign:
    with a busty woman, a polar bear, and a mocha-koma.
His heart-rate fluctuates... his glasses display the ticker for mocha-koma going up.

With his ear phones in, he hears the doppler of a guy's theme song playing:
    "Hey, when you're walking down the street, and the people that you meet..."
Jamal thinks: "Remind me to linger in nostaligia of doug, later..."

Jamal sees an orange that he is curious about, so he takes off his glasses
    because her magic-wanded form is obscured by the orange.
He hears: "watchout, her 23andthee doesn't jive with yours..."
He puts back on his glasses.
