# Dignity on Both Sides

**Not all esteem is created equal, but all dignity is.**

## Notes for what to do when a divisive activity occurs which many people watch:

### Context

- While on campus, I studied Shrodinger's Equation
- I paid attention to the school of students as a "black box" -- that Americans quiver together as indivdual strings, but tend to eat from the same loaf (Gibran)
- I derived the momentum of memes being transacted from the day before
- Idle hands, Posture, and Risk Receptivity became my KPI for class
- I understood Indemnifications from our Port Property insurance policy (https://perrydime.com/20190529_May_2019_Notes.pdf)
- I learned about how national security is a reason for retrospectively changing insurance policies... from TRIA... and how clauses trickle down into low-level policies
- I then understood Insurance as Governance
- I then derived that the Owner-Manager Dichotomy can be remedied by having traceability on preventive measures taken to alleviate the need for insurers to cover EVEN that which is indemnified (https://perrydime.com/20191031_Responsibility_Futures_V8.pdf)
- That caution should not be thrown to the wind; though, loose boxers are Gramma's recommendation

### Morale These Days in Media

- The Bud Light Flamboyance was similar to the Indian Cow Fat being used in bullets
- The Taiwanese leadership mentioned there being "dignity on both sides"
-- this is an indicator of a high-context society
- Could our low-context society realize there is dignity on both sides with the outcome of the 2024 Superbowl?

### The Fabric of Solidarity

- A Vietnam Vet taught me about how I have no clue what it would be like to experience a COMPLETE loss of solidarity - that which keeps us from lunging on each other
- I started to ask: what is the fabric of Solidarity?

### Entering a new 3rd Space

- 1st space is home, 2nd space is work and a local grocer, 3rd space is the "bowling alley"
- The book "Bowling Alone" makes the case that the US is losing it's 3rd spaces
- Humans are naturally attentive to diverse ideas during the 1st encounter
- (Americans do not know how to decipher ethnicity as well as they can race... in the sense of dialects)

### The Modern Noble Lie

- Inquity, not labor inequity, is manifest in aesthetic appearance
- Beauty disrupts priorities, but objectivity lies in the socialization of taste (Critique of Judgment - Kant)

### Entering a new 3rd Space is like Shorting a Solidarity Index

- When we enter a new 3rd space, we borrow shares of solidarity and sell them at the current price
- We are banking on the cost of the shares going down over time so that we can buy in and return the shares at a lower price
- Money as a measure of status does not quite cut it anymore, we are now in a reality of Material, Social, and Scope Capital (https://perrydime.com/CapitalScopeSocial.pdf)

### Dignity is the Shorted Call Option

- Quantity in mind, Dignity is the right to buy at an ideally lower price
- "Dirty Deeds... done dirt cheap"

### Esteem is the Shorted Put Option

- Quantity in mind, Esteem is the right to sell at an ideally higher price
- Not all esteem has a strong foundation

### The Solidarity Index tends towards the impetus of responsibility between the Dignity and Esteem of the Micro-Hegemon of the Community

### During divisive moments that many watch:

- The esteem of the winning side goes up
- The esteem of the losing side goes down

## Morale Model of Infectious Ideas

The change in those who catch logical viruses is proprotional to:

- the number of transactions
- the probability of infection
- the number of those who are transacting who are not infected
- the number of those who are transacting who are infected

and inversely proportional to:

- the sum total of those who are transacting

### "Active" is measured by: the likelihood of fighting if left alone on the battlefield

### "Passive" can become active or remain passive given who they are with

### Infectious ideas are more likely to pass to the passive individual (because of tearing...)

### Infectious ideas live longer in communities where transacting partners do not role specialize

## Shape of the possible outcomes

- Between flat-line zero and a quarter moon "exponential" within a year if the average number of transactions is every week day and the probability of infection is 0.01 and the community has 2,000 members

## Procurement Portals

Every state has a procurement portal, and the federal one is SAM.gov. These are actual measures of the market demand of goods and services. Basing the next move on the trends in the markets is a better idea than relying on selective attention and personal interest... until you have solid esteem from knowing you can recreate your 4-5 F situation / conditions:

### 4-5 F Conditions

- Family
- Fitness
- Finance
- Friends
- (Fucking)

## Trends in Market

https://github.com/jeffy893/cortext.io is the codebase for the https://cortext.io project which enables you to understand trends in hashtags and wikis for the textual sources which you schedule through the pipeline. Alerting, anomaly detection, and root cause analysis can be performed on the predicates (from the text) and the kpi you choose, and therefore order.

## The Monty Hall Problem of Milk

Say you go to whole foods and see they provide

1. Oat Milk
2. Goat Milk
3. Cow Milk

Say you know nothing of the healthiness of these milks, but you choose number 1 and roll with it in your coffee.

Then you discover that Cow Milk is not healthy... should you change the milk you drink to number 2?

The answer is: probly yes - due to the laws of probablity....

This is a dichotomy you have to be comfortable with.

## My Point is that in a world of opportunity, we are defined by what we say "no" to.

### Maintaining Morale (or "Flow") is not easy, and not intuitive... Pascal uniquely thought in Permutations.

# It is okay that the passive partner has options as long as they role-specialize in their transactions.

### West coast city folk make friends at first encounter, but the relationships tend to not last long because they have so many options.

### East coast city folk tend to be rude up front, but will remain friends for life.

### Midwest folk are a mix of the two.

## As you head from the country to the city, the service members will steadily drop the pleasantries

- Pleasantries are a middle class pheonomenon

# All Demeanors Matter - even when Gramma feels your demeanor is mis
