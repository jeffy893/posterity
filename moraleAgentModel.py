"""
Creating a Python code for a state machine that simulates agents in a field engaging in transactions of capital based on their morale can be quite complex. Here's a simplified example of how you might implement such a state machine using Python:


In this code:

Agent class represents individual agents with attributes like capital, community, morale, and state.
The calculate_morale method calculates an agent's morale based on their capital relative to the community's average capital.
The engage_in_transaction method simulates whether an agent engages in a transaction based on their morale.
The update method updates an agent's morale and triggers transactions if their state is "idle."
In the simulation loop, agents interact and update their morale and capital over several rounds.
This code provides a basic framework for simulating agent interactions based on morale and capital. You can further customize it to meet your specific requirements and include additional complexity as needed.
