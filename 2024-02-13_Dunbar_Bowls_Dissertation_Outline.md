# Dunbar Bowls
## Dissertation Outline

Prompt:

Write the outline for a dissertation based on the following:

1. That we metaphorically live in bowls, not bubbles
2. That our bowl of a community is limited to the Dunbar Number limitation (that we can only keep track of about 150 people)
3. That every time we let a celebrity into our field of attention, we are pushing someone out of our bowl who may be in need
4. That the friction between our bowl and the fabric of solidarity in the broader society determines how easy it is to venture to the edge of our bowl: that communities deeply entrenched in institutions like Police, Schools, Church, and difficult to traverse

The central thought experiment of the paper is how Conservation of Momentum makes it so that when you walk on a perfectly round bowl which is on a sheet of ice, the bowl curves up behind whatever direction you are headed

**Title: The Metaphorical Bowls of Human Social Networks: Understanding the Impact of Dunbar's Number and Celebrity Culture**

**Abstract:**  
This dissertation explores the concept of metaphorical "bowls" in human social networks, proposing that our communities are not isolated "bubbles" but rather interconnected, limited by Dunbar's Number. It examines how every time we allow a celebrity into our field of attention, we potentially exclude someone in need. Furthermore, it investigates the friction between our social "bowl" and the fabric of solidarity in broader society and how this friction impacts our ability to engage with those on the periphery of our community. The central thought experiment involves the Conservation of Momentum and how walking on a round bowl affects our social dynamics.
