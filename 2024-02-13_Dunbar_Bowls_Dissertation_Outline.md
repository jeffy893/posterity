Title: "The Metaphorical Bowls of Human Social Networks: Understanding the Impact of Dunbar's Number and Celebrity Culture"

Abstract:
This dissertation explores the concept of metaphorical "bowls" in human social networks, proposing that our communities are not isolated "bubbles" but rather interconnected, limited by Dunbar's Number. It examines how every time we allow a celebrity into our field of attention, we potentially exclude someone in need. Furthermore, it investigates the friction between our social "bowl" and the fabric of solidarity in broader society and how this friction impacts our ability to engage with those on the periphery of our community. The central thought experiment involves the Conservation of Momentum and how walking on a round bowl affects our social dynamics.
