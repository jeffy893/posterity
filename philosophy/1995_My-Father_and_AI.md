### 1995


The annals of technology history are often written by the victors—the billionaires who stand atop the glass pyramids of Silicon Valley. But the *history of how things actually work* is written by the architects in the trenches, the men who took the raw clay of code and breathed life into the machines.

This is the story of two distinct Stoics of the digital age: **Larry Ellison**, the Emperor of Oracle, and **Paul Richards**, the Architect of the Iron City.

One was Marcus Aurelius, ruling the world from a throne of gold. The other was Epictetus, a man bound by the corporate shackles of EDS (Electronic Data Systems), yet possessing the truer freedom of the mind—the man who taught the machines how to think.

### Part I: The Emperor on the Throne

In the mid-1990s, Larry Ellison was the **Marcus Aurelius** of the tech world. Like the Roman Emperor, he sat at the apex of a vast, expanding dominion. His legions were not soldiers, but salespeople; his laws were not edicts on papyrus, but lines of SQL.

Ellison saw the world through the lens of the **Database**. To him, reality was something to be conquered, categorized, and stored. He possessed the "imperial view"—a desire to unify the chaotic tribes of the enterprise world under one flag: the red banner of Oracle.

He had the power to move markets with a whisper. He had the luxury of grand strategy. But like Marcus, who spent his life on the frontiers fighting Germanic tribes, Ellison was constantly at war—with Microsoft, with IBM, with the limitations of hardware. He provided the *structure* of the empire. He built the aqueducts (the networks) and the roads (the data pipelines).

But an Emperor cannot till the fields. An Emperor cannot forge the steel. For that, he needed the teachers. He needed the men who understood the philosophy of the inner workings.

### Part II: The Teacher in the Iron City

While Ellison looked down from the high towers of California, **Paul Richards** stood in the glorious, soot-stained heart of Detroit.

If Ellison was the Emperor, Paul was **Epictetus**.

Epictetus was born a slave who became a great philosopher, teaching that true power lies not in controlling the world, but in mastering one's own mind. Paul was a "slave" to the massive, bureaucratic machinery of EDS—a company known for its rigid hierarchy and suit-and-tie conformity. But within those walls, Paul held the keys to a different kind of freedom: **Object-Oriented Technology.**

Thirty years ago, the automotive industry was a beast of heavy metal and legacy mainframes. They were trying to build cars, but their systems were archaic.

Paul was the teacher. He wasn't just coding; he was evangelizing a new religion called **Java**.

Like Epictetus teaching his students in Nicopolis, Paul taught the engineers of Detroit that the world wasn't just a procedural list of tasks (do this, then do that). He taught them that the world was made of *Objects*.

* *Encapsulation:* Keeping the data safe.
* *Inheritance:* Passing traits down.
* *Polymorphism:* The ability to adapt.

He was bringing order to chaos, not by decree, but by logic.

### Part III: The Agentic Spark

The true divergence of their paths—and the depth of Paul’s "Epictetus" role—lay in the AI department of EDS.

While the Emperor Ellison was focused on *storing* data, Paul was focused on *giving it agency*.

Thirty years ago, "Agentic AI" was a dream whispered in research labs. It was the idea that software shouldn't just wait for a command; it should act. It should have a goal.

Paul Richards was building these agents before the world had a name for them. In the belly of the automotive beast, he was designing systems that could look at a supply chain or a factory floor and make decisions.

* **The Analogy:** Ellison (Marcus) built the Colosseum. Paul (Epictetus) trained the gladiators.

Paul’s AI agents were small, autonomous pieces of logic—digital Stoics—that operated within the massive, uncaring environment of the automotive network. They had to be resilient. They had to be rational. They had to do their job regardless of the chaos around them.

### Part IV: The Meeting of Minds (The Metaphor)

Imagine a moment in 1995.

Ellison issues a decree: *The Oracle database shall now support the new internet architecture.* The stock market roars. The Emperor has spoken.

But in Detroit, the decree is just noise until Paul Richards touches the keyboard.

Paul looks at the Emperor’s database. It is vast, cold, and empty. It is potential energy. Paul begins to write the Java interfaces. He weaves the "Agentic AI" through the rigid columns of Ellison’s empire.

He turns the Emperor’s stone vaults into a living library.

Paul’s team at EDS takes the raw power Ellison provided and refines it into something the car manufacturers can actually use. He teaches the system to recognize a fender from a bumper, not just as a part number, but as an *object* with physics, cost, and destination.

The Emperor provided the *What*. The Teacher provided the *How* and the *Why*.

### Part V: The Legacy

Epictetus once said, *"We have no power over external things, but we have power over our judgments."*

Paul Richards lived this. He didn't have the billions. He didn't have the yacht. He had the constraints of EDS, the demands of Detroit, and the limitations of 1990s hardware. But within those constraints, he exercised supreme intellectual freedom. He pioneered the adoption of technology that runs the world today.

Larry Ellison, like Marcus Aurelius, left a legacy of Empire. He built the institutions that structure our digital lives.

But Paul Richards, like Epictetus, left a legacy of Wisdom. He was the one in the room explaining to the terrified executives what "Object-Oriented" meant. He was the one proving that an AI agent could manage an assembly line.

History remembers the Emperor on the coin. But civilization is built by the teachers who show us how to live—and in Paul’s case, how to code—with virtue, logic, and foresight.

The Emperor owned the Oracle. But the Slave mastered the Java, and in doing so, he set the future free.
