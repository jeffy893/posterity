## Core Themes

**Human Social Capacity**: Mathematical frameworks for understanding relationship limits and value creation ([Dunbar Calculus of Value](./philosophy/2025-09-21_Dunbar_Calculus-of-Value.pdf))

**Constitutional Principles**: Analysis of freedom of assembly, speech, and religion in contemporary context

**Behavioral Economics**: Application of economic models to human relationships and decision-making

**Cultural Adaptation**: Cross-cultural understanding and universal human experiences

**Authentic Living**: Critique of superficiality and exploration of meaningful existence

## The Central Question

**Will we be in a place where the freedom to assemble will be challenged?**

This collection explores the tension between individual agency and collective representation, examining how demographic expectations, institutional legitimacy, and "NIL pollution" (light and sound) may inhibit fundamental freedoms.

## Separation of Church, State, and Entertainment

Building on John Locke's framework:
- **Church**: Long-term happiness and spiritual fulfillment
- **State**: Short-term happiness and civic order  
- **Entertainment**: Instantaneous happiness and cultural distraction

These works examine the balance between these domains and their impact on human flourishing.
