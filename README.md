# Posterity

- This repo centralizes **resource allocation simulation** and **models of conflict**

## Posterity is an Android App that simulates the Mating Dances of Bison and Cattle<br>

- To dance with potency is to dance like Bison
- To take the path of least resistence is to dance like Cattle

### A Markov Chain incrementally "hands off" bounded constants to a Guerrilla Lanchester Law
<h4>The attrition factors are set in a way such that Bison are distinct from Cattle - differentiated by their Mating Dance</h4><br>
The Heat Slider is meant to represent the relative likelihood of a dance<br>
The Pace Slider could be thought of as the relative pace of the dance floor<br>
<br>
The graph that appears after the simulation takes place is based on artificial criteria for:<br>
<h3>Should the optimum size of each side of the dance be 3, 7, or 12?</h3>

- indicated by the Y Axis
<h3>Will Bison or Cattle win the conflict within 1.5 hours?</h3>

- indicated by the X Axis
<h3>Will there be a cross-over between Bison and Cattle?</h3>

- ideal for those aiming to experience an event with longevity and balance

# Context

## AI summary of Dean Barry's conclusion in: Insurance as Governance

### I am not smart enough to write the following, but am to recognize it... it'll take years for me to understand, if ever - JFR

In modern societies, insurance plays a crucial role in governance due to the emphasis on minimal state intervention and reliance on local risk knowledge. The state, with its territorial, national, and sovereign dimensions, has undergone a process of minimalization, collaborating with private sector institutions. Private corporations exert influence by expanding territorial jurisdiction, managing populations based on consumption preferences, and implementing risk management regimes. The state becomes 'governmentalized' as it partners with these private institutions, shaping and being shaped by them. In this context, individual choice is a tool for governing populations, framed within the discourse of corporate and consumer rights but accompanied by responsibilities in liberal risk regimes. Those deemed irresponsible may face exclusion from participation in the concerned institution.

Liberal risk regimes, based on six key assumptions, advocate for a minimal state, relying on individuals' self-restraint, willingness to share, and self-governance. The emphasis is on a 'free market' providing security and prosperity through market relations, with a focus on knowledge for risk taking and management. In this regime, individuals are expected to be informed, self-sufficient consumers responsible for their own political economy. Inequality is framed as a matter of choice within a liberal risk regime, and the state itself is considered a risk requiring perpetual reform.

The insurance industry exemplifies the fragmentation of the state into liberal risk regimes, filling the void left by the downsizing of the state. While sharing goals with the state, such as pooling risks to provide security and solidarity, the industry also reflects the liberal preference for individual choice and responsibility. It operates within legal frameworks, utilizes surveillance and audit systems, relies on expert decision-making, and establishes its policing apparatus.

The insurance industry and the state are loosely coupled, with the industry inviting state regulation in specific areas. The state, in turn, benefits from the industry by offloading compensation responsibilities, generating employment, tax revenues, and capital investments in government bonds. The state collaborates with the insurance industry at the ideological level, actively promoting individual responsibility for risk as part of its efforts to minimize its role, including an attack on the welfare state.

In the context of a minimal state and liberal risk regimes, the state shifts its role to promoting individual responsibility for risk management. The focus is on moral risk transfers, with the individual responsible for controlling their risk environment through market-based security products, including insurance. Despite insurers desiring hard evidence for risk assessment, inherent knowledge limitations persist, particularly in dealing with natural disasters and medical uncertainties.

Facing scientific and technical knowledge gaps, insurers turn to moral risk, encompassing ethical evaluations in actuarial practices. The concept of moral risk extends beyond the traditional "moral hazard," involving not only the insured but also incentivizing risky behavior by other parties in the insurance relationship. Moral risks arise in the interactive dynamics of the insurance relationship, influencing behavior with potential immoral consequences.

Moral risks are evident on both sides of the insurance relationship, involving insured parties and insurance companies. Factors such as strained cultural relationships, economic stakes, and inadequate policing contribute to moral risks. The business of insurance involves complex negotiations among state legislators, regulators, industry associations, and global/local insurance companies, impacting decisions related to loss ratio security, corporate governance, and market conduct. These complexities challenge the simplistic assumptions of liberal risk regimes, highlighting the intricate interplay between state, insurance industry, and political economies.

Insurance underwriting involves uncertainties and is akin to gambling, with consumers being integral to the product. Unknown risks emerge due to human dynamics within risk pools, and advancements in science and technology may unveil unforeseen liabilities. Financial risk exposure, especially in life insurance, can lead to moral risks and significant consequences for both insurers and policyholders.

Insurers aim for profits by managing loss ratios, but the quest for better investment returns can lead to irresponsible practices. Corporate limited liability rules and compensation schemes cushion insurers from investment risks, potentially encouraging riskier behavior. The business of reinsurance introduces moral risk judgments, and scandals involving deception, known as 'passing the trash,' are not uncommon.

Compulsory insurance on insurance and compensation schemes are mechanisms to address solvency risks, but they may pass on costs to policyholders. The highly competitive insurance industry faces challenges such as overcapacity, entry of major banks, technological changes, and self-insurance trends. Governance mechanisms, including state regulation, industry associations, actuaries, and insurance on insurers' practices, navigate these challenges.

State regulators and insurers collaboratively govern each other in liberal risk regimes. State regulation focuses on public confidence, protecting policyholders, and fostering corporate governance improvement. Insurance industry associations coordinate member activities, shaping practices and influencing legislation, but dominance by a few powerful companies can lead to challenges. Actuaries contribute to corporate governance by establishing quantitative criteria, negotiating political economies, and interpreting data creatively.

In summary, the insurance industry, operating in a competitive environment, grapples with uncertainties, moral risks, and governance challenges. The collaboration and competition between state regulators, industry associations, and insurers shape the landscape of insurance practices, emphasizing the complexity and interdependence of these entities in navigating risks and uncertainties.
