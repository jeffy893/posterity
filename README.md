# Writings for Posterity

There is talk of experts: those of us with collections of experiences who also have accreditations or seals of approval. **Will we be in a place where the freedom to assemble will be challenged?**

```
... the right of the people peaceably to assemble...
```

Will there be an ask for our assemblies to be representative of expected demographic distributions - reflective of patterns in constituent stakeholders of the deliberations of the assemblies? It is not just the aspect of `petition[ing] the Government for a redress of grievances` that will be posed as a false kpi - in that, to transition from free play to instrumental play to deliberation, a cohort must first assemble - it will also be that the act of `drawing lines in the sand` using existence-based speech patterns will be pitted against those who use expression-based speech patterns - the latter having the `out` of being able to, at a later time, discredit the experts who they claim expressed what will have turned out to be antithetical to deliberated objectives by government stakeholders (excuse my tenses).

So what?

Well, militaries impose their will, farmers nurture society, and artisans tinker to progress technology. Deliberations within these classes ought not be inhibited with the requirements of representative demographics; and, also SOPs based on the brand-managed `NIL light pollution` and `NIL sound pollution`. It's as if the faint stars are drownt out by city lights, and we cannot possibly connect what stars remain into the same constellations... It's as if steam whistles are blowing at decibels as loud as jet planes breaking the sound barrier... this `NIL light pollution` inhibits the `freedom of religion` - which comes first... this `NIL sound pollution` inhibits the `freedom of speech` - which comes next, and prior to the `freedom of assembly`, and all three are within the first ammendment of the US constitution.
