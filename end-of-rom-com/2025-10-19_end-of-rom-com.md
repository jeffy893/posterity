# The End of Rom Com


![end of rom com](./end-of-rom-com.png)

The scent of burnt kale and existential dread hung heavy in the air of the Peterson-Smith household. "Darling," pronounced Professor Ashton Peterson, adjusting his artisanal spectacles, "this isn't just a stir-fry; it's a *deconstruction* of patriarchal food norms. It's a culinary representation of the very relational friction we are exploring in our own lives! It's *material*." He beamed, as if the right academic buzzword could transform the charred, sulfurous mass into a triumph.

His wife, Professor Vivian Smith, a woman whose patience had been eroded by a thousand student essays on "The Other," sighed. "Ashton, it's just dinner. And our agreements state that the kitchen table is for *transparency*, not just retrofitting your domestic failures into publishable insights for your next monograph on 'Affective Labor in Post-Monogamous Cohabitation.'"

Their daughter, Juniper, 14, rolled her eyes so hard she nearly sprained a retina. Their son, Milo, 18, just scrolled through his phone, a grimace fixed on his face. He was witnessing, in real-time, the material for his future therapist.

The "agreements" were the foundational texts of their polyamorous odyssey, primarily penned by Ashton. He’d envisioned a utopian future of enlightened love, a veritable commune of emotionally evolved adults. In reality, it was a hellscape of scheduling conflicts, passive-aggressive notes, and Ashton's relentless intellectualizing of everyone's bad feelings.

Ashton, ever the trailblazer, had been the one to "open" their marriage, driven by a desire for *growth* and a desperate need to prove he was still relevant in a world that had moved past his brand of Gen X irony. This exploration had led him to Chloe.

Chloe was not some flighty artist; she was Dr. Chloe, 30 years old, with a PhD in the Sociology of Reproductive Futures. And she was a wreck. She desperately wanted a child, and her biological clock wasn't just ticking; it was a deafening, anxiety-fueled gong. She had intellectually bought into Ashton's "deconstructed family unit" but was now emotionally trapped, often sending Ashton tearful, late-night texts. "Ashton, I just took another ovulation test," one read. "I'm crying. My fertility isn't a *theoretical construct*. Are we *really* doing this, or am I just a footnote in your paper on 'Alternative Kinship Models'?"

Ashton, of course, rationalized this. "Her anxiety is a predictable, albeit stressful, byproduct of bio-essentialist programming, Vivian. We'll work through it in our next check-in. It's a fascinating longitudinal study!"

Vivian, meanwhile, had found her own... *data point*. Dave. Dave was not a strapping football coach; Dave was just... Dave. He was their age, worked in systems management, was slightly paunchy, divorced, and utterly ignorant of the dense theoretical drama he had stumbled into. He was just a guy from Hinge who couldn't believe his luck. He thought "kitchen table polyamory" meant they sometimes ordered pizza for three. He was, as Ashton generously put it, "a control group." Vivian just saw him as an opportunity for sex that didn't come with a required reading list.

One particularly chaotic Saturday night, Ashton found himself at a university mixer, nursing an organic prosecco. He spotted Sarah across the room, a charming, witty woman whose laughter cut through the din. Sarah was an aspiring stand-up comedian, and her eyes lit up when Ashton started talking. He decided to lay it all out, framing his humiliation as a badge of evolutionary honor.

"It's... liberating, really," he began, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. "My wife, Vivian, is actually at a hotel nearby with her... *partner*... Dave. It's all based on our agreements. We believe in radical transparency, in pushing past the archaic constructs of jealousy. It’s a rich tapestry of human experience, really. Almost... *comedic*, in its complexity."

Sarah's eyes gleamed with a terrifying, journalistic focus. "Dave, you say?" she asked, pulling out her phone to subtly take a note. "Dave... Thompson? Works in systems management?"

Ashton puffed out his chest. "The very same! A fascinating example of the 'everyman' navigating post-modern relational structures. We find his lack of theoretical grounding... refreshing."

Sarah's grin was predatory. "Oh my god. That's my date for tomorrow. The one who listed his interests as 'craft beer' and 'ethical non-monogamy (negotiable).' This isn't just a bit; this is my whole Netflix special."

The evening ended with Ashton feeling less enlightened and more just... used as unpaid source material. He arrived home to Juniper’s scathing critique of his "performative vulnerability for narrative capital" and Milo's muttered observation that "this whole 'love is boundless' thing is just making everyone boundlessly miserable, except maybe for Dave, who's just getting laid."

The next morning, Vivian, looking serviced but not necessarily refreshed, made a perfectly round omelet. "Ashton," she said, without looking up from the whisk, "I understand Sarah *kept* her date with Dave."

Ashton groaned.

"She called me," Vivian continued, her voice flat. "To *thank* me. Apparently, she asked Dave about his 'relational philosophy,' and he just said he was 'happy to be part of the team.' She's calling her new routine 'The Gen X Sadness Funhouse: Or, Why I'm Glad I Froze My Eggs.'"

Ashton buried his face in his hands, then suddenly perked up, the desperate light of rationalization returning to his eyes. "You see, Vivian! We *are* the narrative! We are the raw material for the cultural zeitgeist! This isn't tragedy; it's *relevance*! Our domestic life is a *text*! We are living the very corrosion of the institutions we write about! It's messy, yes, but it's *authentic*!"

As if on cue, his phone buzzed. A text from Chloe. It was a picture of a positive pregnancy test, followed by a long string of crying-face emojis. "Ashton, it's positive. Oh god, what are we doing? Is this a family or a research project? I feel so cheap."

Ashton stared at the burnt kale remnants. He wanted the grand, traditional ending, the rom-com walk down the aisle. But this was the reality of the generation after the boomers, the ones who had to renegotiate everything. They had all the phones, all the apps, all the "optionality." They'd tried to write their own enlightened script, but in cheapening the currency of sex and relationship, they'd created a tragicomedy. They weren't ending in marriage; they were ending in a shared Google Calendar, a stand-up routine at their expense, and a PhD in sociology sobbing over a pregnancy test, possessed of a profound, academic, and deeply undignified sense of low esteem. The rom-com was dead. Long live the peer-reviewed personal essay.
